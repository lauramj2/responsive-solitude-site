                Arch-Mage of the College of Winterhold, and Harbinger of the Companions, to name a few of the many leadership positions the Dragonborn holds across Skyrim's various factions. You will be in good hands when you visit Solitude!</p>

                        Residence of the Emperor of Skyrim and headquarters of the Imperial Legion.

                        The Temple of the Divines is a popular tourist attraction, located off of the castle's courtyard.

                    <h4>The East Empire Trading Company is an Imperial merchant organization controlled by the Empire. 
                        The Company's main warehouse is located in a building on the Solitude docks, also serving as the Company's headquarters. 
                        This is best admired from the outside, however, as the guards are hostile to all trespassers.
