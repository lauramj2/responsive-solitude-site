                <h4>
                    The Blue Palace is home to the High King of Skyrim. 
                    Built on the tip of the arch Solitude stands upon, the castle commands attention when viewing the city from afar. 
                    Tours are available for the magnificent courtyard, as well as for the castle's interior.

                    Residence of the Emperor of Skyrim and headquarters of the Imperial Legion. 
                    This fortress is separated from the rest of Solitude by its towering walls. 
                    The Temple of the Divines is a popular tourist attraction, located off of the castle's courtyard.

                    The Company's main warehouse is located in a building on the Solitude docks, also serving as the Company's headquarters. 
                    This is best admired from the outside, however, as the guards are hostile to all trespassers.
